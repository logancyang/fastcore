# Release notes

<!-- do not remove -->

## 1.0.10

### Breaking Changes

- remove `parallel_chunked`, use `chunksize` arg to `parallel` instead ([#81](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore/issues/81))

### New Features

- move fastscript to fastcore.script ([#84](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore/issues/84))
- add `run_proc` and `do_request` ([#83](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore/issues/83))
- added `chunksize` to `parallel`, which passes to `ProcessPoolExecutor.map` ([#82](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore/issues/82))
- move metaclasses and delegates et al to new `meta` module ([#80](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore/issues/80))

## 1.0.4

### New Features

- Remove numpy prerequisite ([#75](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore/issues/75))
  - NB: fastcore's `L` and other collection features still work with numpy
    arrays, but they do so internally using instance methods, so numpy is no longer a
    prerequisite, and numpy is not loaded if not used

## 1.0.2

### Bugs Squashed

- "has default params. These will be ignored" shown when not appropriate ([#74](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore/issues/74))

## 1.0.1

### Breaking Changes

- Change arguments of `store_attr()` and remove `store_attrs` attribute ([#71](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore/pull/71))
  - `store_attr`'s API has changed. `self` is now the second parameter, and is optional. Previously, if no names were passed to store,
    names were taken from the `store_attrs` attribute; now, however, names are taken from the list of arguments to the current function.

### New Features

- Warn if defaults passed to `typedispatch` ([#73](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore/pull/73))

- Add `urlread` and `urljson` ([#72](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore/pull/72))

## Version 1.0.0

- Initial release
